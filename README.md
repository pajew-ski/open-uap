# Universal Agentic Project

> A bootstraper for a universal agentic project. Let's freaking go!

## Operational Workflows

### 0. Genesis (System Instantiation)
Executed via ephemeral bootstrapper to generate this architecture (Reference only):
```bash
bun run lfg.ts
```

### 1. Hydration
Execute immediately (if not already done) to install dependencies:
```bash
bun install
```

### 2. Autonomous Operation
The System is designed for Agentic Control. 
**Handover Instruction:** Instruct your AI Agent to ingest `llms-full.txt` and run `bun test`.

## Architecture Taxonomy
- **`AGENTS.md`**: The prescriptive rule set. Defines behavior and strict operational constraints.
- **`llms.txt`**: The machine-readable index. Follows [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org).
- **`llms-full.txt`**: A compiled, XML-encapsulated snapshot for one-shot prompting.

## Quality Gates
CI enforces: No Context Drift, No Emojis, Green Tests.
